## Inspiration
I love walking in the moon light and a recommended path can be a fun tool for people to use
## What it does
It determines the moon's current azimuth, altitude and phase. It then calculates a route, recommended time to walk and visualizes the route 
## How I built it
React + TypeScript, Google JS API, Directions API, TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
## Challenges I ran into
Calculating the route. The suggested route kept sending me into the sea
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
My first Google Maps project and that it is yet imperfect
## What I learned
Deeper understanding of moon phases, when it rises and sets and azimuth
## What's next for Moonlight Walking
Improving the algorithm to calculate a perfect route and mobile first version
