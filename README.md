## Inspiration
I love walking in the moon light and a recommended path can be a fun tool for people to use
## What it does
It determines the moon's current azimuth, altitude and phase. It then calculates a route, recommended time to walk and visualizes the route 
## How we built it
- React + TypeScript
- Google JS API
- Directions API
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
## Challenges we ran into
Calculating the route, because the suggested route kept sending me into the sea
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
My first Google Maps project and that it is yet imperfect
## What we learned
Deeper understanding of moon phases, when it rises and sets and azimuth
## What's next for Moonlight Walking
- Improving the algorithm to calculate a perfect route and mobile first version
- User interaction: set distance and prefered location
